    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>I find that I learn best through application.  In school, I was always good math, largely, I believe, because of the repetition of problems in the homework sets.  I was able to learn about a topic, and then practice how that topic is applied to problems.  This project, I hope, will give me the opportunity to learn about new ideas in web development, and apply them to a problem.</p>
    <p>My goal is to get a job as a front-end developer.  The problem is solving how to demonstrate that I will be valuable to an organization.  I will use this project as a way to highlight what I have done in the past, and, possibly more importantly, document how I go about solving a problem.</p>
    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a job as a front-end developer in the Bay Area</li>
      <li>Build a website to highlight my projects and accomplishments</li>
      <li>Learn about new ideas and technologies in web development</li>
      <li>Demonstrate how I can provide value to a new organization</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Project Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Update my resume content to show my accomplishments and projects in an interesting format</li>
      <li>Build a website to replace the need for a traditional paginated resume</li>
      <li>Provide an outlet for continued writing and projects</li>
      <li>Demonstrate my understanding of new ideas and technologies in web development</li>
      <li>Document the way I think about solving problems and completing projects</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="g2">
    <h4>Victory Conditions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Accepted a job offer as a front-end web developer by June 1, 2012</li>
      <li>Zero requests from potential employers for a standard document resume because my site does not communicate the necessary information</li>
      <li>This website is discussed in 100% of my job interviews with potential employers</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Requirements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch by April 15, 2012 so I may start applying to jobs</li>
      <li>Accept a job offer by June 1, 2012 so I may move to the Bay Area by July 1, 2012</li>
      <li>I will complete the website on my own</li>
      <li>The website will need to be completed during nights and weekends while I continue working in my present position</li>
    </ul>
