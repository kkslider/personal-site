      <h1>Establishing a 1 year goal</h1>
      <div class="instruction">
        <p>Your one-year goal is a measurable financial goal for your business. It needs to be clearly stated and ambitious - but realistic. Pure and simple. Without this clarity, it is almost impossible to grow. By creating a one-year goal you always have a target to both focus on and benchmark yourself against. </p>
        <p>Creating a one-year goal can be daunting, but we're going to break it out in 4 easy steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Expenses</strong> &ndash; We'll identify the expenses of your business, both on the personal and company side.</li>
          <li><strong>Revenue Streams</strong> &ndash; We'll help you break out and identify the major revenue streams of your business and label what type of impact each has on your bottom line.</li>
          <li><strong>Costs</strong> &ndash; We'll look at the costs of operating your business, both fixed and variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Breakeven</strong> &ndash; Based on the information above, we'll identify your true breakeven point to see where you're at today and where you think you can be a year from now.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each phase is a big step in identifying your financial goal, but we'll walk you through &ndash; step by step &ndash; so you understand the process and it stays <em>simple</em>, <em>actionable</em>, and <em>doable</em>.</p>
        <p>Are you ready to get started?</p>
