            <p class="revenue-streams-page step">A revenue stream is anything you sell, anything that customers or clients pay you for. In the table below, enter each of your revenue streams. Do you sell products and then ongoing service contracts? Do you have 30-minute appointments and 60-minute appointments? Or maybe you have initial consultations and then follow-up visits. If you sell projects, they might be small, medium or large. If you sell products: List them all, or group them into common categories (Just list them for now, we will dive into the numbers shortly).</p>
            <p class="revenue-percentages-page step">In the percent column below, enter the percentage of your total revenue that each revenue stream contributes. These percentages should be forward looking. If you are launching a new revenue stream that you hope will become your best selling item, input the goal you have for it by year's end. For example, my goal for my new book release is 20% of my total revenue next year.</p>
            <p class="total-revenue-page step">Below you can see the total revenue generated by each revenue stream, based on the percentage of total revenue that it represents. If it doesn't look right, go back one page and change the percentages you entered.</p>
            <p class="average-selling-price-page step">This is where you enter your expected average selling price for each of your revenue streams. It doesn’t have to be exact but it’s important to be thorough in your estimation. For example, take into account seasonal discounts and sales when calculating this average. Sometimes you sell the product for $100 but other times you sell it for $70.</p>
            <p class="average-selling-price-page step"><strong>This number will be the basis for all subsequent calculations so you want to spend some time making sure it’s done right.</strong></p>
            <p class="variable-costs-page step">For each revenue stream, enter the variable costs you incur selling that product/service. For example, if you sell shoes, you have the cost of manufacturing the shoes or buying them wholesale. And if you ship them to your customer, you have the cost of shipping. You might also have the commission you pay a salesperson. These are the costs that you only incur when you sell the product to your customer.</p>
            <p class="variable-costs-page step">Just make sure you don’t double count: an expense can only be a fixed expense or a variable expense - not both. If you pay $30 for monthly access to a phone line and $1 for each minute you call someone on the phone, the $30 is a fixed cost that you probably signed a contract for, and the $1 per minute is the variable cost. You only incur the $1 if you actually pick up the phone and dial it.</p>
            <p class="units-of-sale-page step">Voila! Now you can see the total Units of Sale you need to make in order to cover your costs and keep your business afloat. It’s not unusual to feel that these numbers are high. If so, you have four options:</p>
            <ol class="units-of-sale-page step">
                <li><strong>You can play with the Revenue Percentages</strong>. Take a look at those numbers. First of all, ask yourself if this is the right vision you have for your business: do you want to sell more of A than B? Next, analyze the net profit from each unit sold. Is one revenue stream more profitable than the others? Is it easier to sell more of A than to sell B? Play around with the distribution of your Revenue Percentages, making sure you understand the profitability of each, understand how easy it is to sell each stream in the market you operate in, and making sure the distribution of percentages aligns well with your vision for your business.</li>
                <li><strong>You can charge more for your products/services</strong>. This will reduce the number of units you have to sell to cover your break even as you are making the products more profitable. But be careful! Ask yourself whether that product or service is offered by another business operating in the same market? Raising the price might scare your customers away and onto the other business’ doorsteps. If your product or service is unique and if the customer values it very highly, then go ahead and raise the price in small increments and see what effect it has on your sales.</li>
                <li><strong>You can reduce your hard costs and personal expenses</strong>. You need to tighten that belt and make sure you are not over paying or paying for something you don’t really need. Reflect on those numbers and see where you can trim off some fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Or you can reduce your variable costs so that you can keep more of each dollar of revenue you sell</strong>. Remember, revenue is different from profit! You can make 100 million dollars in revenue but keep none of it if your variable costs are too high. There are several ways you can do this. For example you can re-negotiate your contracts with your suppliers. Or, rethink how you create your product or deliver your service. Again, trim fat wherever possible, but don’t cut into the meat.</li>
                <li>Actually, there is a fifth option. Accept that your business will not breakeven this year, and figure out how to cover the shortfall. Can you take a loan? Stretch out some of your payments due? This is no easy task, but it can be an opportunity to relaunch your business into a cycle of growth. Contact us and let us help you.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="goal-check-page step">Do a final review of your revenue stream and make adjustments if needed. Is this what you want your business to look like by the end of the year? After this we will focus on reaching this goal so it is very important that your goal is well thought out!</p>
            <p class="reality-check-page step">Ok not to beat this horse dead, but I urge you to think one last time about these units that you need to sell to breakeven. Are they realistic? Visualize these amounts! Do you have enough inventory? Are there enough people in the world who would pay for your product/service? Are there enough hours in a day to complete all sales? Take some time and think about it. Don’t rush through this, and don’t set yourself up to fail.</p>
